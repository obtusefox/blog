# The Dangers of Having Hope

## I always have had hope
For about 20 years, I never had the idea that I would eventually fail. It didn't mean my confidence. It was just that, I "should" not fail, and thus, having hope wasn't something actually hopeful. Of course, I failed, numerous times, and sometimes it was so miserable that it ever affected my life after. What held me not to broke was the idea that I would eventually succeed. I could take the entrance exam again, meet another girl, and start going gym next month. It worked. As a means of turning my head from my actual failure. There was always tomorrow. Today always had been something that can be denied, something can be ignored.

## Doomsday eventually comes
However, it cannot go on forever. Doomsday eventually comes. There will be the day when I can procrastinate no more. What should I do when I can no longer have hope? What should I do when there's no room for hope anymore? Doomsday came quicker than I thought. I reached the moment when I cannot start over. When I got bad GPA, I can retake the course. When I broke up, I can remeet some decent and lovely girl. The list went on forever. However, I reached the moment of graduation, which means that I could not retake everything. There would be some other oppurtunities, for sure, but not for those happening in the university. And I will be evaluated for what I've done in the university; for job, graduation school, and so on. I actually did quite nice in High school, so it wasn't that big a concern for me at the time. However, I flunked my college life. I "F"ed on almost everything. Carrer, study, love, money, health, and you name it. For first time in my life, I felt that I'm really doomed.

## Hope can be deceiving
My problem was that, hope was not something that was leading me, but more like something that wss anesthetising me. With hope, I could close my eyes at everthing. I could procrastinate forever. I could always ignore failures -though I couldn't, actually-. That's not what I've should done. I should have kept myself vigilant to failure, I should have gather torn pieces from a failure, and made something out of it. For all those years, hope was blinding me, and I was even blind to the consequences of the blindness. With hope, I could not move on.

## Indeed, I need hopes
I had hopes, but because I never had any hope. However, ironically, I've never felt "hopeful." I was never confident of myself, as I've never had any impressive account of overcoming some dire situations. I was just afraid, and so I prayed to the god of hope. When the war was coming, I wasn't preparing for the bellum. I wasn't sharpning my sword, because, I didn't feel like I could win. For those who have no chance of winning, it is a better strategy just to pray rather than really doing something. So, my hope was deceiving, also in a way that, it really wasn't hope at all. If I was really able to think that I could win and what I do today would bring me to some better state, I would have fought.

## Abandon any hope
Now, I will abandon any hope. Yes, I'm doomed, I will fail, I will be ridiculed and I will be asked, "what have done for all these years?" But still, I won't die. I will still be myself. Although I'm not sure whether I could win, I still can fight. This is where real hope arises. It's not about deceiving and praying that everything will be fine, or that you can do anything. By abandoning any false hope, you come to realize where you really are. The place isn't something you hoped for, but still bearable and not bad. 

## Hope is something gained, not given
Beginning from the bottom bit, you should be finding new and genuine hope. That would come from actaully doing something. Hope should be something gained by experience, not just given. When just given, it can malfunction, because it's just blidingly say that everything will go find, and thus you can just rest. Real hope is rather an evidence. From your own achievements, you can safely concluded that you can make it again. This is what hope should be. Being gained by tear, sweat and blood, it is your history, and the demonstration of yourself. 

Let's be hopeful, not by wearing an eye patch, but by genuinely experiencing that we can actually do something.
