# Yes, I'm Afraid

## I always have had hope
For about 20 years, I never had the idea that I would eventually fail. It didn't mean my confidence. It was just that, I "should" not fail, and thus, having hope wasn't something actually hopeful. Of course, I failed, numerous times, and sometimes it was so miserable that it ever affected my life after. What held me not to broke was the idea that I would eventually succeed. I could take the entrance exam again, meet another girl, and start going gym next month. It worked. As a means of turning my head from my actual failure. There was always tomorrow. Today had been something that can be denied, something can be ignored.

## Doomsday eventually comes
However, it cannot go on forever.
