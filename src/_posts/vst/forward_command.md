# Forward commands
Forward is the thing that most tricked me. Explanations weren't that helpful, either because I was too dull minded, all because they weren't enough. So, I will try to understand and explain the tactic in detailed and kind way.

forward. is the most simple command when the condition is met. But to be honest, I still haven't figured out the right condition for the command. I just tried "hint," and when it said I could, I used it.
