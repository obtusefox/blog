# Ora et Labora

**This is my personal blog, and I would like to share some of my works, in case someone might find it useful.**

The very philosophy of my mind. It means "Pray and Work." This single motto can represent the Rule of Saint Benedict.

To cite from [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict),

> The spirit of Saint Benedict's Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: pax ("peace") and the traditional ora et labora ("pray and work"). Compared to other precepts, the Rule provides a moderate path between individual zeal and formulaic institutionalism; because of this middle ground it has been widely popular. Benedict's concerns were the needs of monks in a community environment: namely, to establish due order, to foster an understanding of the relational nature of human beings, and to provide a spiritual father to support and strengthen the individual's ascetic effort and the spiritual growth that is required for the fulfillment of the human vocation, theosis.

I pray, to keep my zeal and dream.
I work, to stay in this world.
