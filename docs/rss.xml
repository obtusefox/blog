Undetermined, unresponded or unrequited love is something that always drives us crazy -sometimes not just figuratively but actually mentally ill-. Look at Werther. He is one of the most typical depictions of what love should be like in the view of romanticism. His unrequited love was so painful that he shot himself. The story of Werther tells us that unrequitedness is painful, and the pain is what makes love pure and beautiful. As unconscious romanticists, we project this image of unrequited love to our own, consequently deepening our sorrows. However, this really is a terrible and pathetic notion. Because of Werther, we are not able to cure the sorrows and enjoy the rejoicings of the unrequited love. Every love begins as an unrequited one, and it is the most valuable repository for guidances in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrows of unrequited love. All of us know what they are. If we were rational enough, we would not develop our feelings toward someone who are not ready to develop that for us. It is a risky investment with unknown rates of success and earnings. No one would trust one’s whole fortune to such a charlatan equity. But in love, we do. We commit every bit of us to the risky investment. If our love was always destined to be successful, we would not have any reason to be sorrowful. The sorrows come from the fear of the failure: being rejected. We are anxious about our inability to express our feelings toward someone. What if she is already dating someone? What if he feels uncomfortable about the fact that I have crush on him? These thoughts are what make our love so pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, the agony actually arises from the bliss. We are so happy that we fear this happiness would not last forever. We burn with anguish, as we know that the refusal and subsequent disappointments will destroy our already uncontrollably grown bliss. Recall the time when you knew nothing about the one you love. At this moment, you imagine your life was so miserable when the one was not in your life. Your life was so desolate, you were alone, no one ever seemed to understand you, and your life was meaningless. Now, you have finally met someone who can light up your life. You can finally be rescued from the bottomless pit. You are so happy just looking at the one. You fear that this happiness would be ruined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a misleading notion. Your life wasn’t that fun, yes, but your life went on anyway. She won’t rescue you. She is already busy trying to fix her own broken mind. As no human being is perfect, even though he looks flawless, you will find him surprisingly out of order when you get to know him well. This moment, the moment when your love isn’t requited is the only moment when you can be completely joyful. The bliss is soon to be gone, but anyway, it is a nice thing to have.  It’s now or never. It won’t come again, it won’t hurt you. So why not just enjoy the moment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not used to being in such complete bliss. We are so used to unhappiness and darkness (like the famous line from a song, “Hello darkness, my old friend”) that even when we don’t have any kind of misfortune on sight, we try to find or make one. So we generate the fear of losing the happiness by ourselves.  Sadly, we don’t try to live a happy life, but we try to live a familiar one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare these sorrows with that of broken, left love. Regardless of whether it really was  happy or we really loved our partners, we are discarded and devastated. In this case, the anguish is a real one. It is a consequence of actual events. We are betrayed. Someone whom we had believed in more than anyone, anything else had broken the oath of eternal commitment. Our expectations for the merry future had betrayed us. Our investments had turned out to be in vain. We are already too much dependent on something that died too young. We have plenty of reasons to be sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrary, the anguish from unrequited one is not a real thing and can be easily dismissed. It is just a shadow of bliss. We don’t want this pleasant daydream to end. The tension is what makes our mind fluttering, but at the same time, the overstrain is what spoil the pure joy. We should understand the preciousness of our current emotion, and have to learn to enjoy it. It is too precious to be consumed by the fear of the end. We don’t pass a chocolate because of the fear that it will be gone when we’ve eaten it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, its unrequitedness is what makes it so splendid and mighty. We often forget how the love really would be like after it is finally requited. In the act of mutual loving, realities always hinder us. We are always frustrated, always unsatisfied, and always annoyed about something. The more we get to know about our partner, the more our relationship will seem terrible. We will be disappointed at their mediocrity, idiocy and selfishness.  In unrequited love, we don’t have to worry about these trifling things. It’s the only time when we can enjoy pure emotion, not bothered by realities. Then, why don’t we just stay at this status quo? Unfortunately, unrequited love cannot go on forever. Someday, it will be turned into something else. It can be destroyed, or transformed into requited one. Regarding the latter, the experience of unrequited love will empower us to deal with the tremendous amounts of trouble we are going to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our love will be terrible. We can’t expect us and our partners to ignore all of our and their flaws. Sometimes we need to fix that. Throughout the act of ironing our problems in love, we need reasons to continue the hard work. Why should we go through all those things? Why don’t we just give up and look for someone more suitable? Unfortunately, there’s no perfect one who can meet all our demands. Love is not achieved just by one confession, a kiss, or a sex. Love is completed through mostly boring and irritating spending of time. If we were looking for just pure pleasure with no pressure and inconvenience, we shouldn’t start love. Such love doesn’t exist. But we cannot help but love. Rather than expecting our flawless soulmate to turn up, we have to find ways to deal with this too realistic love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the act of idolizing someone, we are blinded. Later, we are often disappointed realizing that one we idolized was too human and how blind we were. However, we were not being blinded. We’ve already seen the those flaws from the very beginning, though not explicitly. And, we were able to love all those flaws. Our verdicts were flawed, but we could approve them. This experience gives us passion and hope for love. We already know how to love someone entirely. It is often a difficult, or even impossible act. But still, we’ve already done that. Our love was more sacred and intenser than the one Buddha or Jesus spoke of. Our love wasn’t rewarded, but we were ready to give everything we had. We were able to accept the one as whole. By the act of doing unrequited love, we experienced how noble our love could be. We also learn to detect the delicate properties of a person in unrequited love. We loved how the one moved his hands, her sleepy looking eyes, how she blurred her sentences, and many more subtle things. We have learned to see the good in a person that even the oneself could not have seen. This is a valuable ability that enables us to love someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why the unrequitedness of unrequited love is a prerequisite for requited one. We need power to keep our love going on. Recall the things we had experienced in the early development of our feelings toward our lovers. By doing so, we can realize how committed we were. Like people do in religious acts, we can fire up our love by recalling the bliss of love. What religions utilize are reminders of grace of god and examples of saints who’ve worked miracles. Like this, we can remind ourselves of the rejoicings we had from unrequited love, and repeat the miracles we’ve done in the early stages of love. We are not looking for a way to endure pain. The process of fostering love itself would be delightful and leisurable, and the fruits of our efforts will be sweeter than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, the unrequitedness will turn into something else. It can be left broken, or sometimes can be requited. When it is broken, you shall not lament as what you’ve enjoyed was the most valuable and pure thing you could have in your life. We should convince ourselves that the end was inevitable. It wasn’t a loss. It was just a temporary thing, and you’ve enjoyed it nevertheless. When it is requited, let’s celebrate. But never forget the precious emotions and lessons you got in the unrequited stage, as it was what enabled the love.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Courage Is What We Need]]></title><description><![CDATA[Courage is what we need Courage instead of hope So, I pondered myself.

&lt;p&gt;So, I pondered myself. If it weren’t for hope, what should we have? We need something that can make us live out these terrible moments. My conclusion was, courage. We need courage. Hope can persist only when it can happen. Hope can exist only when there’s a possibility of things getting better. But sadly, we often confront so many “hopeless” situations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three romans, and among them was Horatius, at the bridge, defending the city from invader. Their death was inevitable. Despite their predicted failure, they fought. (And, though the legends says that Romans could defend their city thanks to them, history doen’t say so.) What’s the lesson of the story? You could be noble even if you fail. Thus, you can fight regardless of the predicted results. They fought. We don’t know if they didn’t fear it at all, or whether they were actually so frightened that they lost their minds. Anyway, courage and braveness lead them to confront even the cruellest fate. As a consequence, their name remained, and glorified till today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you don’t have to “actually” fight. We just need the metaphor. Courage leads you to do what you should do, regardless of your current situations and possible results. Courage can be euduring when hope can be dwindling and sometimes even betraying. That’s definition of courage: being able to stand even in the most dire situation. Studying for the exam in which you are expected to fail, that’s an act of courage. Being able to move out of bed, that’s also an act of braveness. Think about it. All those trivial and small things require lots of effort and volition. Our every act of doing what you should be doing is an act of courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we need courage. Let’s praise the greatness of courage, and by doing so, we can learn courage. Like ancient people tried to follow the path of the great by reciting their magnificent accounts, we can do the same. But, it doesn’t need to be something that big. We, in all these cruel moments of reality, survived till this moment. Our past deeds are of heroes. Though we went through some frustrations, it’s okay. Heroes never suddenly pop up. They also need trials and hardships - just like us. So, why don’t we think of ourselves as heroes, and act like one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using Forward in VST]]></title><description><![CDATA[Forward commands Forward is the thing that most tricked me.

&lt;p&gt;Forward is the thing that most tricked me. Explanations weren’t that helpful, either because I was too dull minded, all because they weren’t enough. So, I will try to understand and explain the tactic in detailed and kind way.&lt;/p&gt;

Just forward.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;forward. is the most simple command when the condition is met. I just tried “hint,” and when it said I could, I used it. Conditions for the command is quiet straightforward. When you look at the next command, and if the command doesn’t require additional parameter, you can forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For about 20 years, I never had the idea that I would eventually fail. It didn’t mean my confidence. It was just that, I “should” not fail, and thus, having hope wasn’t something actually hopeful. Of course, I failed, numerous times, and sometimes it was so miserable that it ever affected my life after. What held me not to broke was the idea that I would eventually succeed. I could take the entrance exam again, meet another girl, and start going gym next month. It worked. As a means of turning my head from my actual failure. There was always tomorrow. Today always had been something that can be denied, something can be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it cannot go on forever. Doomsday eventually comes. There will be the day when I can procrastinate no more. What should I do when I can no longer have hope? What should I do when there’s no room for hope anymore? Doomsday came quicker than I thought. I reached the moment when I cannot start over. When I got bad GPA, I can retake the course. When I broke up, I can remeet some decent and lovely girl. The list went on forever. However, I reached the moment of graduation, which means that I could not retake everything. There would be some other oppurtunities, for sure, but not for those happening in the university. And I will be evaluated for what I’ve done in the university; for job, graduation school, and so on. I actually did quite nice in High school, so it wasn’t that big a concern for me at the time. However, I flunked my college life. I “F”ed on almost everything. Carrer, study, love, money, health, and you name it. For first time in my life, I felt that I’m really doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem was that, hope was not something that was leading me, but more like something that wss anesthetising me. With hope, I could close my eyes at everthing. I could procrastinate forever. I could always ignore failures -though I couldn’t, actually-. That’s not what I’ve should done. I should have kept myself vigilant to failure, I should have gather torn pieces from a failure, and made something out of it. For all those years, hope was blinding me, and I was even blind to the consequences of the blindness. With hope, I could not move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hopes, but because I never had any hope. However, ironically, I’ve never felt “hopeful.” I was never confident of myself, as I’ve never had any impressive account of overcoming some dire situations. I was just afraid, and so I prayed to the god of hope. When the war was coming, I wasn’t preparing for the bellum. I wasn’t sharpning my sword, because, I didn’t feel like I could win. For those who have no chance of winning, it is a better strategy just to pray rather than really doing something. So, my hope was deceiving, also in a way that, it really wasn’t hope at all. If I was really able to think that I could win and what I do today would bring me to some better state, I would have fought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;abandon-any-hope&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#abandon-any-hope&quot; aria-label=&quot;abandon any hope permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Abandon any hope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I will abandon any hope. Yes, I’m doomed, I will fail, I will be ridiculed and I will be asked, “what have done for all these years?” But still, I won’t die. I will still be myself. Although I’m not sure whether I could win, I still can fight. This is where real hope arises. It’s not about deceiving and praying that everything will be fine, or that you can do anything. By abandoning any false hope, you come to realize where you really are. The place isn’t something you hoped for, but still bearable and not bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hope-is-something-gained-not-given&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#hope-is-something-gained-not-given&quot; aria-label=&quot;hope is something gained not given permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hope is something gained, not given&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning from the bottom bit, you should be finding new and genuine hope. That would come from actaully doing something. Hope should be something gained by experience, not just given. When just given, it can malfunction, because it’s just blidingly say that everything will go find, and thus you can just rest. Real hope is rather an evidence. From your own achievements, you can safely concluded that you can make it again. This is what hope should be. Being gained by tear, sweat and blood, it is your history, and the demonstration of yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be hopeful, not by wearing an eye patch, but by genuinely experiencing that we can actually do something.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quick Start]]></title><description><![CDATA[Getting Started 😎 1.

&lt;p&gt;Before you move on: If you are not familiar with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Imp&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Logical Foundations&lt;/strong&gt; volume, you might want to review it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this beginning chapter of &lt;strong&gt;Programming Language Foundations&lt;/strong&gt;, we will first deal with equivalences of programs. That is, if two programs, given same states, evaluates to same values, they can be said to be equivalent. W will use the simple language &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Imp&lt;/code&gt; we defined in the &lt;strong&gt;Logical Foundations&lt;/strong&gt; volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition aequiv &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;a1 a2 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; aexp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Prop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;

    aeval st a1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; aeval st a2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

Definition bequiv &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;b1 b2 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; bexp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Prop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the same states, if two expressions are evaluated to a same value, they can be said to be equivalent. Let’s prove some small facts about equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Theorem aequiv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;example&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; aequiv &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;X &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; X&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
Proof&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  intros st&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; simpl&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; omega&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
Qed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

Theorem bequiv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;example&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; bequiv &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;X &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; X &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;imp &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
Proof&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  intros st&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; unfold beval&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  rewrite aequiv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;example&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; reflexivity&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
Qed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s move on to some other trivial theorems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Theorem skip&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;left &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; forall c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  cequiv
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;SKIP&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
Proof&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;(* WORKED IN CLASS *)&lt;/span&gt;
  intros c st st&apos;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  split&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; intros H&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;(* -&gt; *)&lt;/span&gt;
    inversion H&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; subst&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    inversion H2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; subst&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    assumption&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;(* &amp;lt;- *)&lt;/span&gt;
    apply E&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;Seq &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; st&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    apply E&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;Skip&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    assumption&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
Qed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof for the theorem isn’t that complex. One thing you might noticed is that just using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;intros&lt;/code&gt; will not introduce st and st’. But as soon as you split, st and st’ will be automatically introduced. Introducing st and st` explicitly will make it easier to follow our own thesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, just using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;inversion&lt;/code&gt; for every case won’t work, as they will yields too many subcases and it will only complicate the problem more. You should think before proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous chapters, we’ve defined &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Imp&lt;/code&gt; language, which is pretty simple, yet captures the key features of languages like C, Java, and so on. Additionally, we’ve proved some basic properties like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; determinism &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; evaluation

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; equivalence &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; some different ways &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; writing down the
      definitions &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; functional &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; relational definitions &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;
      arithmetic expression evaluation&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; guaranteed termination &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; certain classes &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; programs

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; correctness &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the sense &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; preserving meaning&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; a number
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; useful program transformations

    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; behavioral equivalence &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; programs &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Equiv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      chapter&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will develop the topic in this, and later chapters. Especially in this chapter, we will work on a reasoning system named &lt;strong&gt;Hoare Logic&lt;/strong&gt;. Hoare Logic consists of how to write down the specification of a program, and how to prove their correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need a way of making assertions about properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition Assertion &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prop&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, an assertion takes a state, and outputs corresponding Prop about the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Check Assertion&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above command will output &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt;, as an assertion is actually a type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition as1 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Assertion &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; st &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; st X &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;as1&lt;/code&gt; is an assertion, which means that for any state &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;X = 3&lt;/code&gt; holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Check as1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above will show that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;as1&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Assertion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Check fun (st:state) =&amp;gt; st X = 3.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will show that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;as1&lt;/code&gt; is a function which takes a state and returns a Prop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, “Formally, an assertion is just a family of propositions indexed by a [state].” However, the way of writing an assertion like above way is pretty cumbersome. As we are talking about a state in a Prop, we can ommit &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&lt;/code&gt;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; st &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;st Z&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;st Z&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; m &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;\
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;S &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;st Z&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;S &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;st Z&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; m&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will be written as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Z &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Z &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; m &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;\ &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;S Z&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;S Z&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; m&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the chapter, certain naming conventions will be used to name many things. For variables, uppercase letters like X, Y, Z will denote Imp variables, while lovercase letters like x, y, m, n will denote ordinary Coq variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition assert&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;implies &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;P Q &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Assertion&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Prop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;

Notation &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;P -&gt;&gt; Q&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;assert&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;implies P Q&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;P -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Q&lt;/code&gt; means that P implies Q, i.e. if P holds in some state st, Q will also holds in st. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hoare_spec_scope&lt;/code&gt; means that the notation will only be used in certain scopes, that is, in this case, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hoare_spec_scope&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Open Scope hoare&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;spec&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;scope&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can open the scope like this, and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Notation &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;P &amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&gt;&gt; Q&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;P &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Q &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;\ Q &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; P&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;at level &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; hoare&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;spec&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;scope&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will define iff notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hoare-triple&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#hoare-triple&quot; aria-label=&quot;hoare triple permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hoare Triple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behaviour of a command can be thought to be transitioning from one state to another. So, let’s say, a command &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; starts in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&lt;/code&gt; state and terminates in a final state &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;. In this manner, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;P-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; means that if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&lt;/code&gt; satisfy P, then &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; will satisfy Q. This is called a &lt;strong&gt;Hoare Triple&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; is called the precondition and postcondition of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition hoare&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;triple
           &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;P &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Assertion&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; com&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Q &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Assertion&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Prop &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  forall st st&apos;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     st &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; st&apos;  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     P st  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     Q st&apos;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When written formally, it can be interpreted like this: if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&lt;/code&gt;, with a command &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, progress to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;, if &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; holds for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; holds for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Notation &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ P }}  c  {{ Q }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;hoare&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;triple P c Q&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;at level &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; c at next level&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; hoare&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;spec&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;scope&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use more compact notation above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing these articles as my studying materials, and these will be a kind of rewriting the textbook in a easy, and more explained (or sometimes more concise) way. So I would recommend you to follow the original book, but this one might be helpful if you want to quickly skim or review what you’ve learned, this might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;functional-programming&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#functional-programming&quot; aria-label=&quot;functional programming permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coq is “functional,” in a way that you can only care about how the program works and what values they return. Based on this, you can make formal proofs and sound reasonings about program, or some mathematical thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way it is “fuctional” is that it emphasizes the use of functions. Functions are used like any other objects. For example, a function can take other function as its input, and return another function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common featurs of functional languages is that they provide &lt;strong&gt;pattern matching&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;algebraic data types&lt;/strong&gt;. Often, functions return different values based on the pattern of the input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin by looking at &lt;strong&gt;Gallina&lt;/strong&gt;, Coq’s functional language, and after that, we will look at the tactics we can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enumerated-types&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#enumerated-types&quot; aria-label=&quot;enumerated types permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Enumerated Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coq itself provides small set of built-in features. They don’t have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type. Instead, they provide powerful features to declare our own types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enumerated Types are types that don’t require any parameters to compose its types. They are just “enumerated.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; saturday &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; day
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sunday &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; day&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above Codes define an enumerated type, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;day&lt;/code&gt;. It’s elements are each day of a week. And in this case, return types are explicitly defined, but they can often be left ommitted. For a defined type, you can also define a new function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;weekday &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;day&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; day &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; monday    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tuesday
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; tuesday   &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wednesday
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; wednesday &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; thursday
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; thursday  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; friday
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; friday    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; monday
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; saturday  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; monday
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sunday    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; monday
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;next_week&lt;/code&gt; takes a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;day&lt;/code&gt; typed datum as an input and returns a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;day&lt;/code&gt; typed value. It works based on the type of the input. This is one typical example of how &lt;strong&gt;pattern matching&lt;/strong&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Compute &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;weekday friday&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run the above code to evaluate the code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; monday
     &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; day&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will get the result and the type of the evaluation. We will try checking some facts about the defined function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Example test&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;weekday&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;weekday &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;next&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;weekday saturday&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; tuesday&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This declaration does two things: it makes an assertion and give it a name. It’s assertion is that the next&lt;em&gt;weekday of the next&lt;/em&gt;weekday of saturday is tuesday. We can just let them admitted, or prove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Proof&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; simpl&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; reflexivity&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;  Qed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proof, you can simplify, or evaluate each sides of the equation using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;simpl&lt;/code&gt; command, and if the resulting equation has same value on each sides, you can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reflexivity&lt;/code&gt; to eleminate them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bool-type&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bool-type&quot; aria-label=&quot;bool type permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bool Type&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will try to define boolean type in a familiar way. There are standard libraries containining simple types like this, of course, and you can just use them out of the box. But we will try to see how they are defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bool-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bool-definition&quot; aria-label=&quot;bool definition permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bool Definition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would understand how they are defined just by looking at them. Last two ones are different in that take two parameters instead of just one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like this, you can assign a notation to a defined functions or data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Example test&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;orb5&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
Proof&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; simpl&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; reflexivity&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Qed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the assignment, you can use the new notation, like above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-exercise&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#first-exercise&quot; aria-label=&quot;first exercise permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textbook warns not to explicitly post the answer on the web, so I will put just some of them which require some explanations or ones that I had hard time solving them. For &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Basics.v,&lt;/code&gt; I think no explanation will be needed. Try to fill them up by looking at the codes above. My one advice is to reuse the theorems or definitions to make them simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-on-types&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#more-on-types&quot; aria-label=&quot;more on types permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;More on Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like what we’ve done, we can gradually define more complex types and definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;checking-types&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#checking-types&quot; aria-label=&quot;checking types permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Checking Types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Check &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check the type by using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Check&lt;/code&gt;. For above,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will be displyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Check negb.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, for a function,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;negb
     : bool -&amp;gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;input and output types will be defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;compound-types&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#compound-types&quot; aria-label=&quot;compound types permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Compound Types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, types we looked at were enumerated types, which their constructors themselves become types. Now, we will look at types made by taking an argument or arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Inductive rgb &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Type &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; red &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; rgb
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; green &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; rgb
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; blue &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; rgb&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are enumerated types as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Inductive color &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Type &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; black &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; color
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; white &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; color
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; primary &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; rgb &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt; color&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we can define a new type named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;, which additionally has a compound type constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition monochrome &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; color&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; bool &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; black &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; white &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; primary p &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition isred &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; color&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; bool &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; black &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; white &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; primary red &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; primary &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;numbers-module&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#numbers-module&quot; aria-label=&quot;numbers module permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Numbers Module&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coq에서는, 다른 언어와 마찬가지로, 모듈 시스템을 제공한다. 우리는 자연수 타입 선언과 그와 관련된 함수들을 Module로 만들어보도록 하자. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Module X&lt;/code&gt;로 시작하여, 중간에 해당 모듈에 들어갈 타입 정의를 적고, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;End X&lt;/code&gt;로 끝내준다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Module NatPlayground.
... [ 여기에 코드를 입력 ]
End NatPlayground.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;numbers-type-정의&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#numbers-type-%EC%A0%95%EC%9D%98&quot; aria-label=&quot;numbers type 정의 permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Numbers type 정의&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;이제 그 내부를 채워보자. 마치 Nil과 Cons로 리스트 타입을 정의하던 것처럼,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Inductive nat : Type :=
  | O : nat
  | S : nat -&amp;gt; nat.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O로, Nil처럼 0을 정의하고, S로, Cons처럼 그에 1씩 더해짐을 표현해보자. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;S(O)&lt;/code&gt;는 1, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;S(S(O))&lt;/code&gt;는 2… 그럼 우리는 숫자를 표현하는 방법, representation까지를 만든 셈이다.
이것은 단순히 표기의 문제일 뿐이니,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Inductive nat&amp;#39; : Type :=
  | stop : nat&amp;#39;
  | tick : nat&amp;#39; -&amp;gt; nat&amp;#39;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;와 같이 적어도 무방하다. 이름만 다르지 같은 데이터 구조를 나타내기 때문.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;numbers-함수&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#numbers-%ED%95%A8%EC%88%98&quot; aria-label=&quot;numbers 함수 permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Numbers 함수&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;그럼 함수를 만들어보자. nat type의 n에 대해, 그 predecessor를 반환하는 pred함수.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Definition pred (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
    | O =&amp;gt; O
    | S n&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; n&amp;#39;
  end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;일단 O에 대해서는 predecessor가 O라고 정하자. 그럼 O에 대해서는 O를 반환하고, 그보다 큰 어떠한 S(n’)에 대해서는 n’을 반환한다. 이렇게 numbers 타입들을 정의해보았다.
그런데 coq는 자동으로 데이터 타입을 내부적으로 숫자로 변환하기도 한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Check (S (S (S (S O)))).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;을 확인하면&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;  4 : nat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;값이 반환된다. 자동으로 constructor들을 정의해준 것을 알 수 있다.
이제 이 숫자값에 대해, pred와 유사하게 minustwo 함수를 정의해보자. 우리는 음수 타입을 정의하지 않았으므로, 음수값에 대해서는 O를 반환하자.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Definition minustwo (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
    | O =&amp;gt; O
    | S O =&amp;gt; O
    | S (S n&amp;#39;) =&amp;gt; n&amp;#39;
  end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;으로 정의하고&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Compute (minustwo 4).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;계산해보면, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2: nat&lt;/code&gt; 값을 반환한다. 증명 과정에선 compute 대신 simpl.을 사용하여 evaluate할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fixpoint&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fixpoint&quot; aria-label=&quot;fixpoint permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fixpoint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;앞서 정의한 함수들은 사실 간단한 경우들이다. 그런데 실제로 무언가 유용하거나 좀 더 복잡한 함수를 만들기 위해서는 단순히 각 타입에 대해 한 번에 evaluation이 끝나는 것이 아니라, recursion이 필요한 경우가 있다. 이런 타입에 대해서는 Fixpoint로 함수 선언을 한다.
인자로 주어진 값이 짝수인지를 판별하는 함수를 선언해보자.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Fixpoint evenb (n:nat) : bool :=
  match n with
  | O        =&amp;gt; true
  | S O      =&amp;gt; false
  | S (S n&amp;#39;) =&amp;gt; evenb n&amp;#39;
  end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0, 1의 경우에는 앞서 정의한 바와 같이 정의가 되지만 그보다 큰 수에 대해서는 재귀적으로 함수 정의를 하게 된다. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;S (S n&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;의 경우, 다시 적자면 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1 + 1 + n&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;의 경우는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;이 짝수인지를 evaluate하여 반환한다.
비슷한 방식으로 두 자연수를 더하는 plus 함수를 정의해보자.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Fixpoint plus (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
    | O =&amp;gt; m
    | S n&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; S (plus n&amp;#39; m)
  end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;이를 바탕으로 mult 함수까지 정의해보자. 여러 인자가 같은 타입인 경우 한 번에 타입 선언을 할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Fixpoint mult (n m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
    | O =&amp;gt; O
    | S n&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; plus m (mult n&amp;#39; m)
  end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;혹은, 여러 인자를 한 번에 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;로 구분하여 case matching을 할 수 있다. 대해, 다른 인자의 값이 상관 없는 경우 case matching에서 상관 없는 인자를 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;로 적을 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Fixpoint minus (n m:nat) : nat :=
  match n, m with
  | O   , _    =&amp;gt; O
  | S _ , O    =&amp;gt; n
  | S n&amp;#39;, S m&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; minus n&amp;#39; m&amp;#39;
  end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;이 또한 함수형 프로그램에서 익숙한 convention이다. 이상으로 number type에 대한 간략한 예제를 마친다. 추가적인 exercise는 boolean 예제보단 조금씩 머리를 쓰긴 해야 하지만, 마찬가지로 그렇게 어렵진 않다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;위에서 하던 대로 notation을 적용하자. 그런데 위와 달리 at level, associativity 같은 개념이 추가된다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Notation &amp;quot;x + y&amp;quot; := (plus x y)
                       (at level 50, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.
Notation &amp;quot;x - y&amp;quot; := (minus x y)
                       (at level 50, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.
Notation &amp;quot;x * y&amp;quot; := (mult x y)
                       (at level 40, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;나중에 더 보겠지만, at level은 우선순위를 뜻한다.
associativity는 계산이 어느 방향으로 associative한지를 표현한다.
이에 대해서는 추후 더 자세히 다루도록 한다. “More on Notaion”에서.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;간단한 증명의 방법을 알아보자.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;사실 simpl.에 의한 증명은 앞에서 본 바 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Example test_mult1: (mult 3 3) = 9.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;에서 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;simpl&lt;/code&gt;은&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mult 3 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;을 계산하여 9로 단순화하고 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reflexivity&lt;/code&gt;는 양변이 동일한 경우 양변을 소거한다. 그러면 더 이상 증명할 대상이 사라지기에 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Qed&lt;/code&gt;.
우리는 이제 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/code&gt;이 아니라 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem&lt;/code&gt;을 증명하도록 하자. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/code&gt;은 하나의 사례를 다룬다. 그러나 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem&lt;/code&gt;은 일반적인 대상 모두, 말하자면 forall x such that ~에 해당하는 증명을 다룬다. 이것을 Coq에서는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt;로 쓴다. 나중에는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Fact&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Lemma&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Remark&lt;/code&gt; 등이 더 등장할 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_O_n : forall n : nat, 0 + n = n.
Proof.
  intros n. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;사실 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reflexivity&lt;/code&gt;는 생각보다 많은 역할을 하여, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;simpl&lt;/code&gt;의 역할까지를 함께 수행할 수 있다. 위의 증명은&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_O_n : forall n : nat, 0 + n = n.
Proof.
  intros n. reflexivity.  Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;와 같은 셈. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;intros&lt;/code&gt;는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem&lt;/code&gt;에 나타난 양화사를 해당 문맥에 막게 양화하는 역할을 한다. 이러한 증명의 방법들을 tactic이라 부른다. 나중에 더 많은 tactic들을 보게 될 것. 더 많은 증명의 사례를 보자. 아직은 특별한 tactic이 없기에 어려운 것은 없다.
모든 nat type의 n에 1을 더하면 S n이 된다는 증명&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_1_l : forall n:nat, 1 + n = S n.
Proof.
  intros n. reflexivity.  Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0을 곱하면 0이 된다는 증명. 앞서 말한 것처럼 자동으로 0과 O를 동일시한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem mult_0_l : forall n:nat, 0 * n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n. reflexivity.  Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;이제 보다 복잡한 증명을 보자. 전건 -&gt; 후건의 논리 구조를 따르는 증명이다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_id_example : forall n m:nat,
  n = m -&amp;gt;
  n + n = m + m.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;n=m인 경우 n+n = m+m이다. 이 경우 전건이 만족되는 n,m에 대하여 후건이 만족된다. 우리는 이를 증명하기 위해 전제(가설)를 도입하고, 이 전제에 맞는 방식으로 식을 다시 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rewrite&lt;/code&gt;할 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Proof.
  (* move both quantifiers into the context: *)
  intros n m.
  (* move the hypothesis into the context: *)
  intros H.
  (* rewrite the goal using the hypothesis: *)
  rewrite -&amp;gt; H.
  reflexivity.  Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;첫 줄의 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;intros n m&lt;/code&gt;으로 증명의 과정에 nat 타입의 n, m을 추가한다. 그리고 두 번째 줄의 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;intros H&lt;/code&gt;로, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n=m&lt;/code&gt;이라는 전제 H를 추가한다. 그리고 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rewrite -&amp;gt; H&lt;/code&gt;를 통해 H에 따라 n들을 m으로 고쳐 쓴다. 그럼 양변이 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;m+m&lt;/code&gt;으로 동일해지므로, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reflexivity&lt;/code&gt;를 적용하여 증명을 마칠 수 있다.
그 다음 예시에는 이보다 조금 더 복잡한 형태로, 여러 번의 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;implies&lt;/code&gt;가 등장한다. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_id_exercise : forall n m o : nat,
  n = m -&amp;gt; m = o -&amp;gt; n + m = m + o.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoqIde의 우상단 창에서, 증명 중에 어떤 전제가 도입되었는지, 어떤 변수들이 양화되었는지를 알 수 있다. n, m, o, 그리고 여러 개의 전제를 intros하면 해결할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_1_neq_0_firsttry : forall n : nat,
  beq_nat (n + 1) 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n.
  simpl.  (* does nothing! *)
Abort.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;이 경우 beq&lt;em&gt;nat가 evaluate되지 않는다. 왜냐하면, beq&lt;/em&gt;nat은 인자로 받는 두 수의 case에 따라 그 반환값이 결정되는데, 이 경우 beq_nat의 인자가 n+1이고 n은 어떤 수인지 알려지지 않았다. 따라서 n의 가능한 두 경우, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;와 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;S n&lt;/code&gt;에 대해 경우를 나누어 증명을 해야 한다. 여기에서 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;destruct&lt;/code&gt;를 사용한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_1_neq_0 : forall n : nat,
  beq_nat (n + 1) 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n. destruct n as [| n&amp;#39;].
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.   Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;두 번의 reflexivity는 각각의 case를 증명한다. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[| n&amp;#39;]&lt;/code&gt;는 각각의 case에 변수 이름을 지정한다. 인자를 필요로 하는 type의 경우, 그 인자로 입력될 변수명을 지정해주는 것이다. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bullet&lt;/code&gt;이라 하는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;기호는 각각의 destruct된 경우, 정확히는 증명에 등장하는 subgoal에 대해 증명을 적용한다. 물론 argument를 받지 않는 inductive type에 대해서도 비슷한 tactic이 가능하다. 예컨대 boolean에 대해서는 true와 false의 case를 나누어 같은 식으로 증명이 진행된다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem negb_involutive : forall b : bool,
  negb (negb b) = b.
Proof.
  intros b. destruct b.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.  Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;앞에서 다른 tactic이 그랬듯이, destruct도 여러 단계 적용될 수 있다. 그리고 bullet 대신 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{ ... }&lt;/code&gt;의 괄호를 사용할 수도 있다. 괄호는 한 증명의 시작과 끝을 표시한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem andb_commutative&amp;#39; : forall b c, andb b c = andb c b.
Proof.
  intros b c. destruct b.
  { destruct c.
    { reflexivity. }
    { reflexivity. } }
  { destruct c.
    { reflexivity. }
    { reflexivity. } }
Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;그리고 더 많은 단계에 쓰인다면&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem andb3_exchange :
  forall b c d, andb (andb b c) d = andb (andb b d) c.
Proof.
  intros b c d. destruct b.
  - destruct c.
    { destruct d.
      - reflexivity.
      - reflexivity. }
    { destruct d.
      - reflexivity.
      - reflexivity. }
  - destruct c.
    { destruct d.
      - reflexivity.
      - reflexivity. }
    { destruct d.
      - reflexivity.
      - reflexivity. }
Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Logical Foundations 0.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/&quot;&gt;Software Foundations Course&lt;/a&gt; provides texts and codes for each courses. You can use the file in the IDE, and run the code on the way. It is recommended to use the code file, as you can check how the codes works on the go. For us, let’s begin with the volume 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;coq-on-windows&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#coq-on-windows&quot; aria-label=&quot;coq on windows permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Coq on Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coq provides binaries for Windows, but I don’t recommend using them. For example, you cannot compile using the CoqIDE for Windows. This is one case I faced, but I suspect there to be more problems. Rather, I used WSL and Proof General with Emacs. I will try to provide further instructions on how to install them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-the-textbook&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how-to-use-the-textbook&quot; aria-label=&quot;how to use the textbook permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to Use the Textbook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you unzip the course file you’ve downloaded above, among the files are &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Basics.v&lt;/code&gt;. You might want to open the file in CoqIDE or PG (Proof General.) In the file, you can see comments and codes like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;(** To see how this definition mechanism works, let&amp;#39;s start with
    a very simple example.  The following declaration tells Coq that
    we are defining a new set of data values -- a _type_. *)

Inductive day : Type :=
  | monday : day
  | tuesday : day
  | wednesday : day
  | thursday : day
  | friday : day
  | saturday : day
  | sunday : day.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For CoqIDE, you can run the next block of code with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Down&lt;/code&gt; key combination, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C + c C + n&lt;/code&gt; combination in PG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;day is defined
day_rect is defined
day_ind is defined
day_rec is defined&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run this code block, above message will be displayed. like this, you can read the book and run the code at the same time, and you can delete unnecessary lines while you go on, so that the result would be the essence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome Bee starter]]></title><description><![CDATA[Welcome, Gatsby!

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_n_O_firsttry : forall n:nat,
  n = n + 0.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;을 증명해보자.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Proof.
  intros n.
  simpl. (* Does nothing! *)
Abort.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;그런데 simpl 단계에서 아무것도 되지 않는다. n의 case에 따라 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;가 simplified될 수 없기 때문에. 그럼 앞에서처럼 destruct를 써서 case를 나눠야 할까?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_n_O_secondtry : forall n:nat,
  n = n + 0.
Proof.
  intros n. destruct n as [| n&amp;#39;].
  - (* n = 0 *)
    reflexivity. (* so far so good... *)
  - (* n = S n&amp;#39; *)
    simpl.       (* ...but here we are stuck again *)
Abort.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;마찬가지로 아무 일도 일어나지 않는다. 왜냐하면 두 번째 case에서 S(n’ + 0)이 나타나며 다시금 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;simpl.&lt;/code&gt;이 아무것도 할 수 없기 때문. 여기에서 induction을 도입한다. 귀납. 우리의 예시에선, 어떠한 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;에 대하여 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n = n + 0&lt;/code&gt;이 성립한다면 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;S n&lt;/code&gt;에 대해서도 마찬가지가 성립함을 보여야 한다. 그런데 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n = n + 0&lt;/code&gt;을 이미 보였다면, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;S (n + 0)&lt;/code&gt;에서 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n + 0&lt;/code&gt;을 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;으로 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rewrite&lt;/code&gt;할 수 있을 것이다. 코드로는 다음과 같이 쓴다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Theorem plus_n_O : forall n:nat, n = n + 0.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n&amp;#39; IHn&amp;#39;].
  - (* n = 0 *)    reflexivity.
  - (* n = S n&amp;#39; *) simpl. rewrite &amp;lt;- IHn&amp;#39;. reflexivity.  Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHn’은 귀납적 전제에 붙여주는 이름이다. 따라서 IHn’이 아니라 다른 이름이 되어도 괜찮다. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rewrite &amp;lt;- IHn&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;를 통해 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n+0&lt;/code&gt;을 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;으로 대체한다. 그럼 위에서 해결되지 않던 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;S (n&amp;#39; + 0)&lt;/code&gt;의 경우가 해결된다.
다음 예시로, 모든 n에 대하여 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;minus n n&lt;/code&gt;이 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;임을 증명하자. destruct를 쓰는 증명의 경우&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Proof.
  intros n.
  destruct n as [|n&amp;#39;].
  - reflexivity.
  - simpl.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;마찬가지로 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;S n&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;에서 막힌다. 그렇기에 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;induction&lt;/code&gt;을 도입하자.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Proof.
  induction n as [| n&amp;#39; IHn&amp;#39;].
  - (* n = 0 *)
    simpl. reflexivity.
  - (* n = S n&amp;#39; *)
    simpl. rewrite -&amp;gt; IHn&amp;#39;. reflexivity.  Qed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;여기서 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;intros&lt;/code&gt;는 불필요하다. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;induction&lt;/code&gt;이 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;intros&lt;/code&gt;의 역할까지 해주기 때문이다.
나머지 예제들은 천천히 여태껏 배운 tactic들을 써보면 된다. 다만 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rewrite&lt;/code&gt;에서 화살표의 방향에 따라 다르게 적용된다는 점에 주의하자. 이제부터는 생각을 하며 증명을 해야 한다. 그리고, 앞에서 증명한 Theorem을 바탕으로, 예를 들어 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rewrite plus_n_O&lt;/code&gt;과 같은 tactic을 사용해야 한다. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;plus_comm&lt;/code&gt;은 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;plus_n_0&lt;/code&gt;와 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;plus_n_Sm&lt;/code&gt;을 사용하자.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3.

&lt;p&gt;우선 두 개의 nat을 가지는 pair type을 정의하자.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Inductive natprod &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Type &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;natprod&lt;/code&gt; 타입은 pair라는 하나의 타입 유형을 가지는데, 이 pair는 두 개의 nat를 차례로 받아 하나의 pair를 만든다. 예를 들어&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Check &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;pair &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;를 실행하면,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;pair &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; natprod&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;가 response로 출력된다. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pair 3 5&lt;/code&gt;는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;natprod&lt;/code&gt; 타입의 한 종류이기 때문에, 그 타입은 natprod가 된다. 그럼 이제 이 pair에 대해 함수를 정의해보자. pair 타입이기 때문에 fst와 snd가 먼저 정의되어야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition fst &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; p &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; natprod &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nat &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pair가 아닌 경우는 반환값을 정의하지 않았다. 그럼 이제 pair에다가 좀 더 편리한 표기법을 더해주자.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pair를 대충 정의하였으니, pair의 기본적인 성질들에 대해 증명을 해보자. 일단 surjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Theorem surjective&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;pairing&apos; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; forall &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;n m &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;surjective function은 전사함수, y의 치역과 공역이 같을 때를 말한다. 이 경우에는 아마 이미 정의된 pair p에 대하여 새로 정의한 fst와 snd 함수를 적용했을 때, 그 결과물이 여전히 p이기 때문에, 공역과 치역이 같아진다고 말하는 듯 하다. 위의 경우는 이 p가 무엇을 의미하는지를, (n,m)과 같이 분리해서 적었기 때문에 바로 simplify할 수 있다. 그러나 다음과 같은 경우는 곧바로 simplify되지 않는다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Theorem surjective&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;pairing&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;stuck &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; forall &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;p &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; natprod&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;따라서 우리는 destruct를 통해 p의 패턴 매칭을 해줘야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;아까 정의한 natprod 타입을 보다 일반적으로 확장하여 리스트 형태로 만들어보자. 대부분의 언어에서 list가 정의되는 것처럼,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Inductive natlist &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Type &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; nil  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; natlist
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; cons &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nat &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt; natlist &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt; natlist&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;와 같이 정의하자. cons는 nat 하나와 natlist를 받아 natlist를 만들고, nil은 아무 인자도 받지 않은 채로 natlist를 만든다. 예를 들어 [1, 2, 3]의 리스트는&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition mylist &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; cons &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cons &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cons &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; nil&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;와 같이 정의될 수 있다. 여기에도 마찬가지로 새로운 notation을 더해주자.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Notation &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;x :: l&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cons x l&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

Notation &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;[ ]&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; nil&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
Notation &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;[ x ; .. ; y ]&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cons x &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cons y nil&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;그럼 이제 보다 편하게&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;리스트를 다루는 기본적인 함수들을 정의해보자.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Fixpoint repeat &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;n count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; natlist &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;repeat &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;이 성립한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Fixpoint length &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;l&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;natlist&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nat &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; l &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; nil &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; O
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; h &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; t &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; S &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;length t&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;length 함수는 주어진 리스트의 길이를 반환한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Fixpoint app &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;l1 l2 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; natlist&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; natlist &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; l1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; nil    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; l2
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; h &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; t &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; h &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;app t l2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

Notation &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;x ++ y&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;app x y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;right associativity&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; at level &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;app 함수는 주어진 두 리스트를, 순서대로 결합한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition hd &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;default&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;nat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;l&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;natlist&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nat &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; l &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; nil &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; default
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; h &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; t &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; h
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

Definition tl &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;l&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;natlist&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; natlist &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; l &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; nil &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nil
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; h &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; t &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; t
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hd와 tl은 각각 리스트의 head와 tail을 반환한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;리스트를-이용한-bag의-구현&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#%EB%A6%AC%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%A5%BC-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%9C-bag%EC%9D%98-%EA%B5%AC%ED%98%84&quot; aria-label=&quot;리스트를 이용한 bag의 구현 permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;리스트를 이용한 bag의 구현&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bag은 set과 비슷하지만, 한 element가 여러 번 나타날 수 있다는 점에서 다르다. 즉, 원소의 순서는 상관 없고, 같은 원소가 여러 번 등장할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition bag &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; natlist&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
Definition sum &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; bag &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bag &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bag &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bag은 데이터 구조상으로는 natlist와 동일하다. 그리고 함수 sum은 집합으로는 합집합에 해당한다. sum a b는 a와 b의 모든 원소들을 가지는 상위 bag이다. 따라서, list의 app으로 표현될 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition add &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;nat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;bag&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; bag &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
v &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;해당 bag에 하나의 원소를 더하는 것도 list와 동일하다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;Definition member &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;nat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;bag&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; bool &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt;
negb &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;beq&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;nat &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;count v s&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; O&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;그외에도 이와 같이, v가 들어있는지를 확인하는 member 함수를 만들 수 있다. 이외에도 remove_one, subset 등의 함수를 구현.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[4.

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot;&gt;apply eq2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;를 적용하여 rewrite와 reflexivity를 대신할 수 있다. `apply는 조건문과도 함께 쓰일 수 있다. 적용되는 주장이 한 전제의 귀결인 경우, 전제는 증명될 subgoal들에 포함될 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;
