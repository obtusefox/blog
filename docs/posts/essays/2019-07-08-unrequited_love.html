Undetermined, unresponded or unrequited love is something that always drives us crazy -sometimes not just figuratively but actually mentally ill-. Look at Werther. He is one of the most typical depictions of what love should be like in the view of romanticism. His unrequited love was so painful that he shot himself. The story of Werther tells us that unrequitedness is painful, and the pain is what makes love pure and beautiful. As unconscious romanticists, we project this image of unrequited love to our own, consequently deepening our sorrows. However, this really is a terrible and pathetic notion. Because of Werther, we are not able to cure the sorrows and enjoy the rejoicings of the unrequited love. Every love begins as an unrequited one, and it is the most valuable repository for guidances in love.</p> <p>Sorrows of unrequited love. All of us know what they are. If we were rational enough, we would not develop our feelings toward someone who are not ready to develop that for us. It is a risky investment with unknown rates of success and earnings. No one would trust one’s whole fortune to such a charlatan equity. But in love, we do. We commit every bit of us to the risky investment. If our love was always destined to be successful, we would not have any reason to be sorrowful. The sorrows come from the fear of the failure: being rejected. We are anxious about our inability to express our feelings toward someone. What if she is already dating someone? What if he feels uncomfortable about the fact that I have crush on him? These thoughts are what make our love so pathetic.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the agony actually arises from the bliss. We are so happy that we fear this happiness would not last forever. We burn with anguish, as we know that the refusal and subsequent disappointments will destroy our already uncontrollably grown bliss. Recall the time when you knew nothing about the one you love. At this moment, you imagine your life was so miserable when the one was not in your life. Your life was so desolate, you were alone, no one ever seemed to understand you, and your life was meaningless. Now, you have finally met someone who can light up your life. You can finally be rescued from the bottomless pit. You are so happy just looking at the one. You fear that this happiness would be ruined.</p> <p>This is actually a misleading notion. Your life wasn’t that fun, yes, but your life went on anyway. She won’t rescue you. She is already busy trying to fix her own broken mind. As no human being is perfect, even though he looks flawless, you will find him surprisingly out of order when you get to know him well. This moment, the moment when your love isn’t requited is the only moment when you can be completely joyful. The bliss is soon to be gone, but anyway, it is a nice thing to have.  It’s now or never. It won’t come again, it won’t hurt you. So why not just enjoy the moment?</p> <p>We are not used to being in such complete bliss. We are so used to unhappiness and darkness (like the famous line from a song, “Hello darkness, my old friend”) that even when we don’t have any kind of misfortune on sight, we try to find or make one. So we generate the fear of losing the happiness by ourselves.  Sadly, we don’t try to live a happy life, but we try to live a familiar one.</p> <p>Compare these sorrows with that of broken, left love. Regardless of whether it really was  happy or we really loved our partners, we are discarded and devastated. In this case, the anguish is a real one. It is a consequence of actual events. We are betrayed. Someone whom we had believed in more than anyone, anything else had broken the oath of eternal commitment. Our expectations for the merry future had betrayed us. Our investments had turned out to be in vain. We are already too much dependent on something that died too young. We have plenty of reasons to be sad.</p> <p>In contrary, the anguish from unrequited one is not a real thing and can be easily dismissed. It is just a shadow of bliss. We don’t want this pleasant daydream to end. The tension is what makes our mind fluttering, but at the same time, the overstrain is what spoil the pure joy. We should understand the preciousness of our current emotion, and have to learn to enjoy it. It is too precious to be consumed by the fear of the end. We don’t pass a chocolate because of the fear that it will be gone when we’ve eaten it.</p> <p>Ironically, its unrequitedness is what makes it so splendid and mighty. We often forget how the love really would be like after it is finally requited. In the act of mutual loving, realities always hinder us. We are always frustrated, always unsatisfied, and always annoyed about something. The more we get to know about our partner, the more our relationship will seem terrible. We will be disappointed at their mediocrity, idiocy and selfishness.  In unrequited love, we don’t have to worry about these trifling things. It’s the only time when we can enjoy pure emotion, not bothered by realities. Then, why don’t we just stay at this status quo? Unfortunately, unrequited love cannot go on forever. Someday, it will be turned into something else. It can be destroyed, or transformed into requited one. Regarding the latter, the experience of unrequited love will empower us to deal with the tremendous amounts of trouble we are going to face.</p> <p>Our love will be terrible. We can’t expect us and our partners to ignore all of our and their flaws. Sometimes we need to fix that. Throughout the act of ironing our problems in love, we need reasons to continue the hard work. Why should we go through all those things? Why don’t we just give up and look for someone more suitable? Unfortunately, there’s no perfect one who can meet all our demands. Love is not achieved just by one confession, a kiss, or a sex. Love is completed through mostly boring and irritating spending of time. If we were looking for just pure pleasure with no pressure and inconvenience, we shouldn’t start love. Such love doesn’t exist. But we cannot help but love. Rather than expecting our flawless soulmate to turn up, we have to find ways to deal with this too realistic love.</p> <p>In the act of idolizing someone, we are blinded. Later, we are often disappointed realizing that one we idolized was too human and how blind we were. However, we were not being blinded. We’ve already seen the those flaws from the very beginning, though not explicitly. And, we were able to love all those flaws. Our verdicts were flawed, but we could approve them. This experience gives us passion and hope for love. We already know how to love someone entirely. It is often a difficult, or even impossible act. But still, we’ve already done that. Our love was more sacred and intenser than the one Buddha or Jesus spoke of. Our love wasn’t rewarded, but we were ready to give everything we had. We were able to accept the one as whole. By the act of doing unrequited love, we experienced how noble our love could be. We also learn to detect the delicate properties of a person in unrequited love. We loved how the one moved his hands, her sleepy looking eyes, how she blurred her sentences, and many more subtle things. We have learned to see the good in a person that even the oneself could not have seen. This is a valuable ability that enables us to love someone.</p> <p>That is why the unrequitedness of unrequited love is a prerequisite for requited one. We need power to keep our love going on. Recall the things we had experienced in the early development of our feelings toward our lovers. By doing so, we can realize how committed we were. Like people do in religious acts, we can fire up our love by recalling the bliss of love. What religions utilize are reminders of grace of god and examples of saints who’ve worked miracles. Like this, we can remind ourselves of the rejoicings we had from unrequited love, and repeat the miracles we’ve done in the early stages of love. We are not looking for a way to endure pain. The process of fostering love itself would be delightful and leisurable, and the fruits of our efforts will be sweeter than ever.</p> <p>Someday, the unrequitedness will turn into something else. It can be left broken, or sometimes can be requited. When it is broken, you shall not lament as what you’ve enjoyed was the most valuable and pure thing you could have in your life. We should convince ourselves that the end was inevitable. It wasn’t a loss. It was just a temporary thing, and you’ve enjoyed it nevertheless. When it is requited, let’s celebrate. But never forget the precious emotions and lessons you got in the unrequited stage, as it was what enabled the love.</p></div></div></div> <div class="column no-pad-r sm-25 xl-33 xsNone smNone post-sidebar"><div class="bizu box-default post-sidebar__bizu bizu--vertical"><div class="bizu-image"><span class="bizu-close">×</span> <a href="YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="/general/web-development.png" alt="Illustration of a user studying online" class="bizu-image__image"></a></div> <div class="bizu-info"><a href="YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" class="bizu-info__link bizu-info__text">
