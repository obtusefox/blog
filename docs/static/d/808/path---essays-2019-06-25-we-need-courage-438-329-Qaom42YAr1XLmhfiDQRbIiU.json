If it weren’t for hope, what should we have? We need something that can make us live out these terrible moments. My conclusion was, courage. We need courage. Hope can persist only when it can happen. Hope can exist only when there’s a possibility of things getting better.

Their death was inevitable. Despite their predicted failure, they fought. (And, though the legends says that Romans could defend their city thanks to them, history doen’t say so.) What’s the lesson of the story? You could be noble even if you fail. Thus, you can fight regardless of the predicted results. They fought. We don’t know if they didn’t fear it at all, or whether they were actually so frightened that they lost their minds. Anyway, courage and braveness lead them to confront even the cruellest fate. As a consequence, their name remained, and glorified till today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-dont-need-to-die-of-course\"><a href=\"#you-dont-need-to-die-of-course\" aria-label=\"you dont need to die of course permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>You don’t need to die, of course.</h2>\n<p>No, you don’t have to “actually” fight. We just need the metaphor. Courage leads you to do what you should do, regardless of your current situations and possible results. Courage can be euduring when hope can be dwindling and sometimes even betraying. That’s definition of courage: being able to stand even in the most dire situation. Studying for the exam in which you are expected to fail, that’s an act of courage. Being able to move out of bed, that’s also an act of braveness. Think about it. All those trivial and small things require lots of effort and volition. Our every act of doing what you should be doing is an act of courage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lets-chant\"><a href=\"#lets-chant\" aria-label=\"lets chant permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Let’s chant</h2>\n<p>Yes, we need courage. Let’s praise the greatness of courage, and by doing so, we can learn courage. Like ancient people tried to follow the path of the great by reciting their magnificent accounts, we can do the same. But, it doesn’t need to be something that big. We, in all these cruel moments of reality, survived till this moment. Our past deeds are of heroes. Though we went through some frustrations, it’s okay. Heroes never suddenly pop up. They also need trials and hardships - just like us. So, why don’t we think of ourselves as heroes, and act like one.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Courage Is What We Need","date":"June 25, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/essays/2019-06-25-we_need_courage/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/essays/2019-06-24-dangers_of_hope/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Dangers of Having Hope","category":"essays"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/WebDev/2019-07-08-wsl-npm-perm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fix some EPERM or EACCESS errors in NPM in WSL","category":"webdev"}}}}
