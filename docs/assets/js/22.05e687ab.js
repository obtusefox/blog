Undetermined, unresponded or unrequited love is something that always drives us crazy -sometimes not just figuratively but actually mentally ill-. Look at Werther. He is one of the most typical depictions of what love should be like in the view of romanticism. His unrequited love was so painful that he shot himself. The story of Werther tells us that unrequitedness is painful, and the pain is what makes love pure and beautiful. As unconscious romanticists, we project this image of unrequited love to our own, consequently deepening our sorrows. However, this really is a terrible and pathetic notion. Because of Werther, we are not able to cure the sorrows and enjoy the rejoicings of the unrequited love.

If we were rational enough, we would not develop our feelings toward someone who are not ready to develop that for us. It is a risky investment with unknown rates of success and earnings. No one would trust one’s whole fortune to such a charlatan equity. But in love, we do. We commit every bit of us to the risky investment. If our love was always destined to be successful, we would not have any reason to be sorrowful. The sorrows come from the fear of the failure: being rejected. We are anxious about our inability to express our feelings toward someone. What if she is already dating someone? What if he feels uncomfortable about the fact that I have crush on him?

At this moment, you imagine your life was so miserable when the one was not in your life. Your life was so desolate, you were alone, no one ever seemed to understand you, and your life was meaningless. Now, you have finally met someone who can light up your life.

We will be disappointed at their mediocrity, idiocy and selfishness.  In unrequited love, we don’t have to worry about these trifling things. It’s the only time when we can enjoy pure emotion, not bothered by realities. Then, why don’t we just stay at this status quo? Unfortunately, unrequited love cannot go on forever.
